## IO Auth n Identity domain utilities

This monorepo package contains a bunch of utilities and scripts to facilitate
some types of operations.

### How to run a script

From the root of the monorepo simply run
`yarn workspace utilities <SCRIPT_NAME> <...ARGUMENTS>`

### Session expire queue insert script

This script inserts batch of items into a queue.
To run it launch from the monorepo root

`yarn workspace utilities build && yarn workspace utilities session:expire:insert <PARAMETERS>`

When `--help` is passed, an help message will greet the user with description for all parameters.

#### Limit the numbers of items visible to the queue hourly

Let's say you want to limit the hourly visible items in the queue.
The script uses the `visibilityTimeout` parameter (expressed in seconds) to determine
when an item will become visible.

To limit the visibility hourly you need to configure the parameters as such:

```
HOURLY_BATCHES = DESIRED_HOURLY_LIMIT / SINGLE_BATCH_SIZE
TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER = 3600 / HOURLY_BACHES
```

With this in mind, we would call the script with `--singleBatchCount=... --timeoutMultiplier=...` according to the calculations made above.

### Table importer

This script copies the entities from a storage account table to another one.
To run it launch from the monorepo root

`yarn workspace utilities build && yarn workspace utilities table:import <PARAMETERS>`

When `--help` is passed, an help message will greet the user with description for all parameters.
